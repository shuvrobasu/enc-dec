# Modified Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool

## Overview

This tool provides a custom implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. It offers a fast and easy-to-use method for encrypting text and files. The encryption process is designed to be resistant to online decryption tools, making it suitable for moderately sensitive information.

## Features

- **Strong Encryption**: The tool applies three layers of encryption for added security.
- **Customizable Shift Value**: Users can specify a shift value for encryption.
- **File Chunking**: Large files are processed in chunks for improved speed.
- **Base64 Encoding**: The final encrypted text is encoded for additional security.
- **Matrix Animation**: Engaging splash screen using a simulated matrix animation.

## Version History

- **Version 1.0**: Initial implementation of Caesar Cipher Encryption.
- **Version 1.1**: Added functionality to show files with serial numbers for user to select a file to process.
- **Version 1.2**: Added chunk size functionality for faster processing.
- **Version 1.3**: Added file deletion functionality and improved user prompts. ## This is a hidden featurea ## and accessed by typing R at the first prompt.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Choose between encryption or decryption.
3. Select file input (`F`) or text input (`T`).
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt/decrypt files or input text.

## Dependencies

- [color_text.py](color_text.py): Custom color formats and inputs.
- [progress_bars.py](progress_bars.py): Custom progress bars.
- [matrix.py](matrix.py): Simulated matrix splash screen.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all required dependencies are in the same directory.
2. Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

bash
python caesar_cipher.py
